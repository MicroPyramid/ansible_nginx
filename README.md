========

Nginx installation to the Ubuntu server.

Example Playbook
-------------------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      remote_user: root
      roles:
         - { role: micropyramid.nginx }
